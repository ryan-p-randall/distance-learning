## Jekyll can be fun & also frustrating

You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.[^1]  

[^1]: Although the work of digitizing this collection began before I arrived at the Government Documents, Maps, and Microform Services department, the [Indiana Historical Maps Digital Collection](https://iu.edu) project took the bulk of my first year there. A large part of my role as the Maps Graduate Assistant involved digitizing and adding maps to this collection, as well as determining, adding, and standardizing appropriate metadata like tags that relevant researchers would find useful throughout the collection.

## Second  

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

```ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```
