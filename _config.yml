# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.
locale: "en-US" # localize your site's language; you might use `en`, `en-US`, or `en-GB`, or for other countries, consult this chart: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/commerce-server/ee825488(v=cs.20)

# the below lines control what goes in the author sidebar (default is the left-hand side of the screen on desktop and below the header image on mobile)  
# the "icon" lines use icons from either font awesome or academicons; if you want to add more profile links and their associated icons, follow this basic pattern and look at font awesome or academicons for the appropriate code  
# the "url" lines will use what you have added for twitter and github further up in this config file for those sites; for the others you should cut & paste your profile's url for whatever you add
