# Distance Learning  

This Jekyll theme is an academics-focused fork of [Minimal Mistakes GitHub Pages starter](https://github.com/mmistakes/mm-github-pages-starter) that adds some of the techniques from [AcademicPages](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io). Minimal Mistakes was created by Michael Rose and AcademicPages was created by Stuart Geiger—but please don't ask them about how to use this particular fork of their work!  

Fork this repo for the quickest method of getting started with this theme.  

If you're logged in to GitHub:    
1. Fork this repository by clicking on the _Fork_ button on the top right corner. 

"Forking" means that you will copy this whole project and all the files into your account. You'll still need to modify some (but not all!) of them to include your own personal information.  

2. Rename the repository to <yourusername>.github.io  

This will make a GitHub User page with this template—it should be available at `https://<yourusername>.github.io` in a few minutes. (You won't use brackets around your username; I'm using those to show what page of the URL you should change). To rename the repository, click on _Settings_ at the top (the cog icon) and you'll find an option to rename the repository.  

3. Customize your website settings  

Edit the `_config.yml` file to change all the settings to reflect your site and your preferences. To edit the file using GitHub's web interface, click on it and then click on the pencil icon. Any line that has a `#` in the `_config.yml` file is a comment. The rest of the lines are the actual settings. I'll add more documentation about this soon.  

Contains basic configuration to get you a site with:

- Sample posts.
- Sample top navigation.
- Sample author sidebar with social links.
- Sample footer links.
- Paginated home page.
- Archive pages for posts grouped by year, category, and tag.
- Sample about page.
- Sample 404 page.
- Site wide search.
