# Distance Learning  

This theme for GitHub Pages intends to help you make a personal academic page that is hosted by GitHub Pages, using only the GitHub online interface. 

This Jekyll theme is an academics-focused fork of [Minimal Mistakes GitHub Pages starter](https://github.com/mmistakes/mm-github-pages-starter) that adds some of the techniques from [AcademicPages](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io). To remove as many barriers to use as possible, this theme reduces the advanced features from AcademicPages and loads as much as possible from the remote theme version of Minimal Mistakes. These changes should minimize the chances that you'll run into error messages or maintenance issues.  

Minimal Mistakes was created by Michael Rose and AcademicPages was created by Stuart Geiger—but __please__ don't ask them about how to use this fork of their work! Instead, use the "issues" feature here if you can't find an answer to your question after you've searched their documentation and the "issues" sections of their GitHub pages.  

## Build Your Site  

Fork this repo for the quickest method of getting started with this theme.  

If you're logged in to GitHub:  

### 1. Fork this repository 

You can do this by clicking on the _Fork_ button on the top right corner of this page.  

"Forking" means that you will copy this whole project and all the files into your account. You'll still need to modify some—but not all!—of the files to include your own personal information. You can do that through GitHub's web interface.  

### 2. Rename the repository to `<yourusername>.github.io`  

This will make a GitHub User page with this template—it should be available at `https://<yourusername>.github.io` in a few minutes.  

You won't place brackets around your username; I'm using those to show the specific portion of the URL you should change. To rename the repository, click on _Settings_ at the top (the cog icon) and you'll find an option to rename the repository.  

### 3. Customize your website settings  

Edit the `_config.yml` file to change all the settings to reflect your site and your preferences. To edit the file using GitHub's web interface, click on it and then click on the pencil icon. Any line that has a `#` in the `_config.yml` file is a comment. The rest of the lines are the actual settings. I'll add more documentation about this soon.  

Contains basic configuration to get you a site with:

- Sample posts.
- Sample top navigation.
- Sample author sidebar with social links.
- Sample footer links.
- Paginated home page.
- Archive pages for blog posts grouped by year, category, and tag.
- Sample about page.
- Sample 404 page.
- Site wide search.

## Advanced Uses  

If you're comfortable with Jekyll and GitHub, you can certainly take this theme and use it elsewhere. In other words, you can edit it using tools like Atom or Notepad. You can pull and push files using tools like GitKraken and GitHub Desktop. You can use Jekyll and a command line interface to test out your changes locally, run only on your computer. You can even host it elsewhere, like Reclaim Hosting or any other place you have place the files.  

As I develop the documentation, I intend to clarify how and why you might want to do those advanced uses.

## Troubleshooting

If you have a question about using Jekyll, start a discussion on the [Jekyll Forum](https://talk.jekyllrb.com/) or [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/jekyll). Other resources:

- [Setting up a Jekyll site with GitHub Pages](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/)
- [Configuring GitHub Metadata](https://github.com/jekyll/github-metadata/blob/master/docs/configuration.md#configuration) to work properly when developing locally and avoid `No GitHub API authentication could be found. Some fields may be missing or have incorrect data.` warnings.
